# Chicago Data Analysis with SQL

## Overview

This repository contains two projects aimed at analyzing various aspects of Chicago using SQL. The projects leverage SQL queries and techniques to extract insights from datasets covering crime, socioeconomic indicators, and public schools in the city.

## Contents

### Chicago_SQL-Analysis.ipynb

This notebook tackles various analytical challenges by utilizing SQL queries on datasets related to crime, socioeconomic data, and public schools in Chicago. It explores techniques such as:

- Data aggregation: Summarizing crime data to find total counts or averages.
- Filtering: Identifying specific subsets of data, such as community areas with certain characteristics.
- Subqueries: Utilizing nested queries to answer complex questions or retrieve specific subsets of data.

### Chicago_Advanced-SQL-Analysis.ipynb

In this notebook, advanced SQL techniques are employed to delve deeper into the datasets and perform more sophisticated analyses. This includes:

- Advanced filtering: Selecting data based on multiple criteria or complex conditions.
- Views: Creating virtual tables to simplify complex queries or improve query performance.
- Stored procedures: Implementing reusable SQL code blocks to perform specific tasks or calculations.
- Transactions: Managing database operations to ensure data integrity and consistency.

Each project emphasizes the importance of understanding the dataset structure, defining clear analytical objectives, and formulating SQL queries that efficiently address the problem at hand. By leveraging SQL effectively, valuable insights can be gleaned from the Chicago datasets, aiding in decision-making and problem-solving processes.
